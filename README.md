Simple SimonGame
This project serve me to learn a little bit more about the Jquery library, It really simplified all of my typing that I usually do using simple Javascript with document object model. I learned how to create simple animations with Jquery commands. 
This project represent a Simon game, a gamePattern is created by generating some random number which will select colors, when the color is selectd. It is shown to the user by a simulation, the user has to reproduce the sequence by memorizing his previous inputs.

The languages used are Html Css Javascript and Jquery library.
